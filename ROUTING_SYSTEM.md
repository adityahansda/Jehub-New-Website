# Authentication-Based Routing System

## Overview
The application now automatically redirects users based on their authentication status, providing a seamless experience for both logged-in and anonymous users.

## Routing Logic

### Home Page (`/`)
The home page (`pages/index.tsx`) now acts as a smart router:

1. **Loading State**: Shows loading spinner while checking authentication
2. **Coming Soon Mode**: If `NEXT_PUBLIC_COMING_SOON_MODE=true`, shows coming soon page
3. **Authenticated Users**: Redirects to the new Home Dashboard
4. **Anonymous Users**: Shows the regular home page (`Home_New`)

### Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)
A protected route that:
- Shows the Home Dashboard for authenticated users
- Redirects to login page for anonymous users
- Includes loading states and proper error handling

## User Flow

### For Anonymous Users
1. Visit `/` → See regular home page
2. Click "Sign in" → Go to login page
3. Login successfully → Redirect to `/` → Automatically see dashboard

### For Authenticated Users  
1. Visit `/` → Automatically see dashboard
2. Visit `/dashboard` → See dashboard
3. All protected routes work seamlessly

### For Logout
1. Click logout → Redirect to `/` → See regular home page

## Implementation Details

### Modified Files
- `pages/index.tsx`: Added authentication checking and conditional rendering
- `pages/dashboard.tsx`: New protected dashboard route
- `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`: Updated to support light/dark mode switching
- `src/pages/Home-Dashboard.tsx`: New modern dashboard component

### Authentication Flow
1. **AuthContext** provides user state and loading status
2. **Pages** check authentication status on render
3. **Conditional rendering** based on user authentication
4. **Automatic redirects** using Next.js router

### Loading States
- Consistent loading spinners during authentication checks
- Prevents flash of wrong content
- Smooth transitions between states

### Theme Support
- Dashboard fully supports light/dark mode
- Theme toggle in dashboard header
- System preference detection
- Persistent theme settings

## Routes Summary

| Route | Anonymous User | Authenticated User |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| `/` | Home page | Dashboard |
| `/dashboard` | Redirect to login | Dashboard |
| `/login` | Login page | Redirect to home (→ dashboard) |
| `/dashboard-demo` | Demo page | Demo page |

## Testing the Flow

### Test Case 1: Anonymous User
1. Visit `/` in incognito mode
2. Should see regular home page
3. Click sign in → Login page
4. Login → Should see dashboard

### Test Case 2: Authenticated User
1. Login to the application
2. Visit `/` → Should see dashboard immediately
3. Visit `/dashboard` → Should see dashboard
4. Logout → Should see regular home page

### Test Case 3: Direct Dashboard Access
1. While logged out, visit `/dashboard`
2. Should redirect to login
3. After login, should see dashboard

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Remember intended route after login
- [ ] Role-based routing (admin, user, etc.)
- [ ] Middleware for API route protection
- [ ] Enhanced loading states with skeleton screens
- [ ] Progressive enhancement for better UX
